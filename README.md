# MLSMOTE: Approaching imbalanced multilabel learning through synthetic instance generation

Learning from imbalanced data is a problem which arises in many real-world scenarios, so does the need
to build classifiers able to predict more than one class label simultaneously (multilabel classification).
Dealing with imbalance by means of resampling methods is an approach that has been deeply studied
lately, primarily in the context of traditional (non-multilabel) classification.

Process of synthetic instance generation for multilabel datasets (MLDs) is studied and
MLSMOTE (Multilabel Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), a algorithm aimed to produce
synthetic instances for imbalanced MLDs, is proposed. An extensive review on how imbalance in the multilabel
context has been tackled in the past is provided, along with a thorough experimental study aimed
to verify the benefits of the proposed algorithm.
